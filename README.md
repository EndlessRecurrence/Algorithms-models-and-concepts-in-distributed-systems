# Algorithms, models and concepts in distributed systems
Coursework for the AMCDS subject.

## Notes

### Types of distributed algorithms

1. fail-stop algorithms, designed under the assumption that processes can fail by crashing but the crashes can be reliably detected by all the other processes;

2. fail-silent algorithms, where process crashes can never be reliably detected;

3. fail-noisy algorithms, where processes can fail by crashing and the crashes can be detected, but not always in an accurate manner (accuracy is only eventual);

4. fail-recovery algorithms, where processes can crash and later recover and still participate in the algorithm;

5. fail-arbitrary algorithms, where processes can deviate arbitrarily from the protocol specification and act in malicious, adversarial ways; and

6. randomized algorithms, where in addition to the classes presented so far, processes may make probabilistic choices by using a source of randomness.
